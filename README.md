captcha-decoder
===============

This module takes a captcha (image) as input and partitions it into
what it believes are n new images, where each new image is a discrete
character found within the original captcha.

This work is a derivation of an original work by bboyte01@gmail.com,
http://www.boyter.org/decoding-captchas/.

## Example

    $ decaptcha captcha.jpg 
    captcha.jpg
    (1.8571428571428572, 'f')
    (1.375, 'e')
    (1.43, 'u')
    (1.4, 'h')
    (1.52, 'u')
    (1.5125, 'e')
